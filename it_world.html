       <h1>Four Thriving IT Fields</h1>
       <br><br><br>
       <h2>1. Cybersecurity and privacy</h2>
       <h6>by Tran Minh Nhat</h6>
       <br><br>
       <h3>Achievements and predictions</h3>
       <p> <img src="images/pic1.png" alt="cybersecurity">
         Cybersecurity and privacy is a prominent domain in the IT world, it plays a role of a protector for the wide expanse
         and development of IT technologies. Cybercrime can even be a potential threat that terrorize nations. Therefore, cyber
         security is also thriving, and has its own state of the art in many aspects. In this context, the state of the art is
         about the greatest and latest development of technologies used in this domain. Cyber attacks are growing faster and
         faster, so many professionals have to come up with advanced solutions, and one of which is Artificial Intelligence
         (AI). Due to large enterprises and the development of Internet of Things, Cloud computing, and many more; they
         create a massive attack surface for cybercrime, and so there are billions of signals and data that need to be analyzed
         to measure the risk<b>[1-Nhat-cybersecurity privacy]</b>. With the advance of AI, this is a huge favor for cybersecurity when
         it helps them increase their security performance and reduce the breach risk. Not just the AI, there are more and more
         sophisticated technologies used to counter cyber attacks.</p><br><p>Moreover, there are such software like behavioral analytics
         used in cybersecurity in order to supervise suspicious activities. For example, Bioprinting, these markers can
         how the employees type or use the mouse to consider any possible dangerous behavior. Not just that, Man-in-the-Middle
         attacks (MiM) is also a challenge when hackers can secretly transfer or potentially interfere into the communications
          between two parties and control the conversation to steal information. Fortunately, with the amazing innovation of
          Virtual Dispersive Network (VDN), the issue can be solved by using this innovation to divide or split the message
          into numerous parts. Next, it encrypts the data and guides it to independent paths, so hackers have to waste more
          time to find what they are looking for.</p><br><p>As mentioned above, cybersecurity is in its state of the art with so many
          helpful innovations used against cybercrime. At the moment, there are more and more IT security companies and
          organizations which are the rising defense line in the world of IT. All of the methods above are among the available
          solutions to fight against cybercrime and protect privacy. To secure privacy, organizations have put more effort
          into investing in cybersecurity and spreading the common knowledge of how to protect privacy to many users. It is
          projected that there would be more to be done soon in the next 3 years in terms of laws and policies to help develop
          IT security.</p><br><p>It is conceivable that technologies are not enough to help protect user’s information and prevent cyber
          attacks; therefore, legislation and operations must be activated to counter cybercrimes. General Data Protection
          Regulation (GDPR) is known as the first set of laws that protect consumer privacy, and there will be more privacy
          laws activated worldwide which will cover 75% of the world’s population by 2023<b>[2-Nhat-cybersecurity privacy]</b>.
          In order to do this, authorities will have to be more dedicated to this field to make the most out of this issue when
          these cybercrimes tend to get worse from time to time if there are only limited actions. Inside the domain, changes
          also appear and the potential achievement for the next few years is AI, which will be a core component of all
          cybersecurity systems <b>[3-Nhat-cybersecurity & privacy]</b>. This technology has become common in recent years, and the
          productivity of which is so outstanding and far more better than a human. With full integration, cybersecurity
          developers can take the advantage of AI to detect potential risks and vulnerabilities, then fix the problems before
          someone exploits these issues. They can also use AI to create many simulations of cyber attacks to discover weak
          points which can be patched soon.
       </p>
       <br><br>
       <h3>Cybersecurity and its influence</h3>
       <p>Prosperity and thriving developments of the IT world can not be denied, but there would be nothing without the
         presence of cybersecurity when black-hat hackers and cyber attacks can be a significant threat to all above.
         From the insider perspective, cybersecurity is and always will be the crucial role of protecting the world of IT.
         That is why with the growing developments in cybersecurity in terms of technology and legislation, changes appear
         positively. In the future of higher development in cybersecurity, a healthy environment of business and communication
         regarding IT World can be ensured. There will be more cyber attacks prevented and more businesses will be protected,
         knowledge and awareness regarding cybersecurity will become well-known as more laws are conducted which makes privacy
         more efficient when more people understand the seriousness of cybercrime.</p><br><p>Inside the industry, cybersecurity developers
        can increase their productivity in their attempts to block malicious activities with many advanced technologies.
        In addition, people that are involved in the IT World will be most affected. Individuals in various businesses will be
        relieved as the frequency of cyber attacks and data loss will likely reduce; hence, this will help them avoid economic
        and reputational loss. Users’ private information will be secured more than ever, more policies and technologies will
        have been developed to protect the people’s rights in the IT World. However, with all of this, we also have to expect
        more sophisticated techniques of cybercrime which is likely to be a potential threat used against new developments in
        cybersecurity. Cybersecurity’s developments  are inevitable; therefore, more jobs will be created for the need of
        expanding the industry. The current jobs of Cybersecurity Specialist, Engineer, Analyst, and Architect will be in dire
        need even in the present. Along with this, there will be deeper and more diverse developments of the technologies used
        in cybersecurity (AI, behavioral analytics, zero trust model, VDN,etc.). Thus, jobs and technologies not only will not
        have any redundancy but also reach out and thrive in many ways.</p>
       <br><br>
       <h3>Cybersecurity in my eyes</h3>
       <p>Knowing that the area of cybersecurity and privacy has had such advances in technologies and laws, I feel excited and
         inspired. However, the field will continue to grow and expand in the future, which will absolutely bring a new wind to
         my daily life. My future path relates a lot to this particular domain, so its developments will do me a lot of favors.
         There will be so much more for me to learn in this field. Also, it will give me larger opportunities in my job
         decisions because there will be more technologies to study in cybersecurity. Moreover, I stay on the computer and the
         Internet a lot for studying and entertainment, so with a future of better cybersecurity, I will be safer with my
         private information on many websites that I registered. It will be an inspiration for me to learn more and immerse
          myself in this area because I see the importance in all of the new developments, which will help the IT World
          stay away from being exploited by cybercrime and black-hat hackers.</p><br><p>Since high school, some of my friends and I
          have been attracted by the growing reputation of fancy developments in the IT world, especially cybersecurity.
          They were so into it that most of them changed their major in college to IT in order to become a future cybersecurity
          specialist or engineer. Not just my friends, in my family, my father also sees the strength of  having decent IT
          security, and he said to me that his company also hired a cybersecurity group for the company’s network, even
          though it is a construction company. On his workstation and other devices in my family, he installed and trusted
          the cybersecurity company's software to protect and secure the privacy. Therefore, more innovations in cybersecurity
          and privacy will certainly be good news to people around me and myself. Eventually, we will be able to head into a
          safer and healthier future of IoT, Metaverse, and many more  with further evolution in cybersecurity and privacy.</p>

          <h2>2. Cloud Computing</h2>
          <h6>by Le Tran Duc Huy</h6>
          <br><br>
          <h3>Overview of cloud computing</h3>
          <p> <img src="images/pic2.png" alt="cloudcomputing">
            Cloud computing is playing a managing role in the IT world. Because of the rapid growth of IT, data storage become
            a potential problem with many developers since they are not only having to worry about protecting their data, but
            they also need managing their data in the correct ways which is a problem to many developers since they have a lot
            of work to do so that is why they need cloud computing. The current state of the art of cloud computing is the
            application of cloud computing and the latest development around it. Currently, cloud computing not only helps the
            developer to manage and store their data on the internet, but it also helps them to back up that data when they
             need or share that data with anyone. Cloud computing also helps people to connect to other people's computers
             and control it with the consent of the owner. Due to the development of cloud computing, there are many services
             or applications made from cloud computing. At the moment, cloud computing are three common service: Software as
             a Service (SaaS) basically a service allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet,
             Platform as a Service(PaaS) is a service provide a platform so that the customer can develop, run, manage software
             application without building and maintaining the infrastructure , and finally Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS)
            is a service that offer essential compute, storage and networking resources on demand, on a pay-as-you-go basis.
            Some application and service of cloud computing are email one of the application of SaaS that is very common in
            our daily life where people share information, data with other people, or cloud gaming, where it helps the player
            to play any game on any device without downloading the game or worry about the game requirement, the only problem
            with cloud gaming is about the strong internet connection continuously which is really hard to acquire in these
            days.</p><br><p> Unfortunately, even though cloud computing has a lot of advantages, it still has some drawbacks. For example
            cloud computing still contains a lot of risk. There are some common risks that you can easily meet like data
            leakage, account or service got hijacked, lost data, or the server is attacked. Cloud computing also has a drawback
            that if you are a customer, your control over the service is limited. That means even though you can manage the
            application, data or service operated on the cloud, you will not have access to updating and maintaining the
            firmware, all you can do is wait for the provider to update and maintain the firmware. In the next 3 years,
            <b>[1-cloud computing]</b>the future of cloud computing will most likely represent a combination of cloud based software
            products and on premises computers to create a hybrid IT solution that balances the scalability and flexibility
            associated with cloud and the security and control of a private data center. Companies will simply buy a monitor,
            keyboard, mouse, and a thin client (which basically controls the keyboard, mouse & monitor), for each workstation.
            All the desktop appearance, applications and compute functionality will be handled by a 3rd party cloud provider.
            The key to making all of these happen is the internet, these things are impossible for now since people are still
            struggling with developing the internet. If the internet keeps developing day by day, the dream of the future for
            cloud computing will become possible in the next three years. But for now, the thing that people need to focus on
            right now is to improve cloud computing security if they want to develop it further.</p><br><br>
            <h3>The influence of cloud computing</h3>
            <p>With the development of IT, many business organizations are trying their luck in this major. Many business
              organizations try to move automation, business intelligence and cloud computing is the tool that most of the
              organizations are using as their tool in this major. Cloud computing provides those businesses a way to manage
              their resources online. Many businesses have their own cloud server just for their employees to access the data
             anytime and anywhere. Currently, cloud computing is giving many opportunities to many business organizations,
             with the ability to create a service with cloud computing many companies are trying to use it as a part of their
             products. Even so, many people still worry about cloud computing due to the fear of losing their job. Many people
             still found it is comfortable for them to work with the environment that cloud computing brings to them. Especially
             during covid pandemic, everyone has to work at their home, and cloud computing helps them to continue their job while
             they are still in their house.</p>
             <br>
             <p> Besides business, cloud computing impacts society the most, especially teenagers. Many social media was created
               based on cloud services like Facebook, Zalo, Instagram, Twitter, which is one of the things that every teenager
               likes. Every picture, video that people upload on those social media will be stored on cloud and that means that
               without cloud computing those social media will not complete. Cloud computing also takes a part in entertainment,
               many apps like YouTube, Amazon Prime or Netflix. They use the cloud to deliver to everyone the content that they
               want to watch. During the covid, Cloud computing is one of the things that help the society the most since many
               social media and entertainment are created from it. Also because of the covid, businesses had to change their
               environment online and without cloud computing this will not happen and many businesses will be bankrupting and
               many people will lose their job.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>Cloud Computing in my eyes</h3>
            <p>The application of cloud computing helps people connect to each other easily, especially for the people who are
              studying abroad or far from their home. It helps me, and my family connect with each other when I went and studied
              in the U.S, I used to chat or call my family through messenger, which is a cloud computing application.
              As cloud computing is currently and will be the trend for the next few years, I think I can study more
              about cloud computing. With the course and the help from university, I believe that cloud computing will be
              a challenge to me, but it is not impossible for me to learn about it. Since I have a dream of becoming a game
              developer, cloud computing is a place that gives me more potential customers as cloud gaming is a thing that is
              available right now. Currently, people already found a way to play the game without downloading it and system
              requirements. If I can find a way to make that happen with cloud computing, that means many people will want to
              try my game as they will not need to download the game or worry that their computer cannot handle the game.</p><br>
            <p>Aside from being a part of developing games, cloud computing also can help me in the part of making my own
              social media or taking part in a business since many businesses are owning their own cloud service for their
              company. As for my family, my parents may not think cloud computing is important. But if I let them see all
              the applications of cloud computing in daily life, they can realize and understand the importance of cloud
              computing. With the support of my family, my learning progress of cloud computing will be faster since I do
              not need to think much about the financial problem and having mental support from my family. For now, all I
              need is achieving success in this field to make my family realize the potential of cloud computing. If my parents
              realize the potential of cloud computing that means I also can make my friend realize its potential. And if more
              and more people will learn about cloud computing, they will contribute to cloud computing a lot of new technology
              or services.</p>

            <h2>3. Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other small computing devices </h2>
            <h6>by Doan Thien Di</h6>
            <br><br>
            <p>Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other small computing devices were introduced to help spread the knowledge of Internet of Things. Being the convenient and affordable means of computing, these devices have been well-received all over the world, especially for educational purposes. The Raspberry Pi Pico, which has just been released for a few weeks, has 250,000 copies sold as well as 750,000 units on back order <b>[1-Di-p4]</b>. Universities have been teaching this technology in IT courses as the fastest learning method is having practical experience. Arduino and Raspberry Pi can work as a prototype for a project, or can even become the final product if the inventor is skilled in developing ideas. It is recorded that up until 2016, 17 versions of the Arduino hardware have been commercially produced <b>[2-Di-p4]</b>. On the other hand, a total of 13 different models of Raspberry Pi with new functions updated frequently can be found on the market<b>[3-Di-p4]<b/>. With the variety of these small computing devices, customers can choose the most suitable for their own use.
            </p>
            <p>Raspberry Pis and Arduinos are very useful tools to help users practice basic coding as well as developing their creativity. Their compatibility with various sensors and components makes these devices a perfect prototype for projects, from everyday objects to complicated scientific instruments. The current technology allows these devices to collect outside information to process. Moreover, Arduino and Raspberry Pi also provide wireless connection, which lets users control the devices from a far<b>[4-Di-p4]</b>. With the main board and other compartments, customers will be able to build their own model, and then program their own software. The available software allows users to code easily using basic knowledge of Python and C language. The project can vary from setting a retro game or a game server to even monitoring your house using both Arduino and Raspberry Pi<b>[5-Di-p4]</b>. Makey Makey is a little different from its Arduino counterpart as everyday objects are involved in the making of a program. This device is more suitable for teaching children about technology since its application is limited
            </p>
            <p>Small computing devices have great potential in this century where technology advanced with incredible speed. The co-founder of Raspberry Pi, Eben Upton has announced at the recent tinyML Summit 2021 that Raspberry Pi would be able to have built-in machine learning<b>[1-Di-p4]</b>. With the ability to continue learning and improving,
              small computing machine devices would make prototyping ideas easier. In order to achieve this goal, the development team has to make a massive improvement of the new in-house chip. In addition, the focus of Raspberry Pi's in house application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) team is shifted into lightweight accelerators for ultra
              low power machine learning applications<b>[1-Di-p4]</b>. With this improvement, high learning ability could be processed with a low and affordable power source. Moreover, the cooperation of the three board companies would give birth to a combination board that includes machine learning, camera, microphone and screen in a Pico
              package<b>[1-Di-p4]</b>. Another focusing point is the introduction of future silicon in the form of a lightweight accelerator<b>[1-Di-p4]</b>. Small computing devices would continue to be developed and widespread because of how pragmatic they are when used in everyday life. These devices, such as Raspberry Pi and Arduino, are
              predicted to be the future of the Internet of Things(IoT). As the IoT became widespread, more “smart cities” would be built. According to a report, 66% of cities in the US are investing in smart city technology<b>[6-Di-p4]</b>. Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Makey Makey and other small computing devices might not directly be the main
              processor, but they would contribute in making the prototype for the IoT projects. With the help of IoT, the world would gradually ascend to a next level where people could live in smart and convenient cities, monitored with programs. Smart products such as smart LED streetlights or parking systems not only reduce the redundant
              funds but can also be time-saving <b>[7-Di-p4]</b>, which is very important in this rusing era.
</p>
            <p>Citizens of these smart cities would understand how IoT could change their daily lives little by little in a better way. People can even try to build their own smart system within their house using small computing devices such as Raspberry Pi or Arduino in order to have a better understanding of the IoT while creating a small
              model of a “smart city” inside their residence. However, as a part of the world can enjoy the benefits of IoT, others are struggling to keep their jobs from being taken away by the IoT. Hardik Tiwari<b>[8-Di-p4]</b>, engagement lead at Zinno, predicted that about 120,000 jobs would be impacted by the IoT, where 90,000 jobs would be
              lost and only 25,000 jobs would be created by 2021. With the IoT, monitoring and controlling over the internet is made easier and automatic, which would become a threat to jobs such as office administration, support staff and people that work for maintenance. In addition, new professions that are IoT related such as IoT product
              managers or robot coordinators would then become popular and in high-demand<b>[8-Di-p4]</b>.  
            </p>
            <p>The application of IoT makes life more convenient so that people could spend more time for family or personal development. Our family could hang out more, talking about our day or listening to wise lessons from the elders. Living in a modern society, people will have to quickly adapt with this fast-changing world. As IoT would become a trend in the next few years, I would have to spend more time learning about the IoT. With courses in university as well as extra studying, I believe building small gadgets from Raspberry Pi or Arduino inside my own residence could be made possible. The process of planning ideas together with  creating prototypes through trials and errors could be an opportunity to improve practical experience. Aside from the knowledge gained from doing experience, having real projects that can be applied in daily life could let parents realize the importance of learning about IoT. Having the empathy and support from family not only can solve financial problems but the mental satisfaction could act as a great boost on the learning progress. If I could achieve some success in this field, my family and friends would understand the potential of IoT, thus they would be intrigued by IoT. More and more people could learn of the IoT, which would contribute to the development of technology.
