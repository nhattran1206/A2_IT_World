          <td>Nhat as a teammate is a very dependable guy, he always gets the job done as fast as he can, not only that, but his work is also very well polished, and we can all see that he didn’t be hasty about his work. Furthermore, he is always active and always be ready to help his teammate when they ask for help.  </td>
          <td>Something I very admire about Di is that she is very good at managing and organizing. She was able to collect each of our individual work and combine it into an appropriate and fascinating final work. Her assigned works are pleasant to read through and overall, doesn’t require much attention. </td>
          <td>Huy is a very great team member, he accomplishes his work very fast and on time. His work is also very well done and doesn’t contain many errors to fix. With that said, he is also very cooperative and communicate with the team a lot.</td>

          <td>An is a model teammate that every team has, he can be cooperative, and responsive. Thus, he is the person that gathered up a team that its teammates had not known each other quite well yet. This helped a lot in our work progress</td>
          <td>DISCARDED</td>
          <td>As An has mentioned, there is no one in the team that can be as organizing and well-managing as Di. She helped collect our work together in an effective way, and for me, that is a big favor for our group assignments </td>
          <td>Huy is not so active, but I see responsibility in him. He did not nominate himself for group tasks, yet he is very dedicated and responsible for his assigned works of what was left. An adequate qualification of collaboration.</td>

         <tr>
          <th>Di</th>
          <td>A reliable teammate that can support others well. He connects the group together and helps us to understand more of our teammates
I hope in our next project, An can keep up with his performance and become better
</td>
          <td>A reliable teammate that did wonderful work. He was very active, always there to support other teammates
He should rely on his teammate more than just doing all the work by himself. Maybe others do not know how to do it, but they can learn. He do not have to shoulder all by himself
</td>
          <td>DISCARDED</td>
          <td>A quiet teammate but also productive. He did what is assigned without any question
I hope we can communicate more in the next project. He should talk more so that others could support him

          <td>An is a great team member, he is gathering up every member of the team while everyone still unfamiliar with each other. He is also supportive which help a lot in our work progression </td>
          <td>Nhat is a good model in our team, he finishes his job as soon as he can and his work is done without any error. He is also cooperative and active in our team, he has help us a lot in our work. </td>
          <td>Di as everyone have mention, she is very good as organizing and well-managing which no one in our group is as good as her. She helped gather our work together and combine it in an effective way. As a team member, I’m very happy to have Di in my team. </td>
