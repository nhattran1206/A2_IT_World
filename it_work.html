        <h1>Cybersecurity Professionals</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>1. Life of a cybersecurity professional can vary in many aspects. In a youtube video called Cyber Security Day In the Life!
           (18 year old Cyber Security Engineer), an 18 year old cybersecurity engineer shared his daily life, we can see he showed
           us all of his activities in a day including his meals, working tasks, and talked about the task’s details. According to
           the video, it seems like his objective is to work on setting up some sort of a scanner that can scan devices on the
           company’s network for vulnerabilities which is called openvas. The video shows the time lapse of his activities, which
           were about doing research on the Internet, looking for reading materials and studying them. It is quite impressive that
           he was just 18 years old. Here is the link:<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdQV4Ci3v0M">Cyber Security Day
           In the Life! (18 year old Cyber Security Engineer)</a></li>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>2. A website called Varonis supports readers with information about a day in a life in cybersecurity. In the website, they
           have collected details of  a day in the life of many job roles regarding cybersecurity in order to give us the best
           perspective about the domain. These details are backgrounds, day-to-day schedule, pros and cons of some job roles such
           as cybersecurity engineer, analyst, and other professionals. The website has revealed the insights of cybersecurity in
           so many aspects. Link to the website: <li><a href="https://www.varonis.com/blog/working-in-cybersecurity/">What Working
           in Cybersecurity is Really Like: A Day in the Life</a></li>

        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>The work of cybersecurity professionals can be diverse with a lot of tasks such as working with tools to look for vulnerabilities
          and improve the IT infrastructure, learning new technologies, working with clients and customers. As mentioned, they have to interact
          with customers to help them solve the problems, and collaborate with their co-workers or their team to do projects. Professionals in
          cybersecurity spend most of their time at their workplace doing research on the Internet. For example, an 18 year old cyber security
          engineer has to stay on his workstation to work with his company’s project for an entire day, or in most of the cybersecurity jobs,
          they have to be at their workplace for many hours ( about 10 hours according to Varonis) just to have time to work with their customers.
          According to these two web sources, the most challenging aspect is that there is no typical day in cybersecurity, everyday is a different
          problem and challenge that they have to tackle; therefore, there are always new things to learn and adapt.

          responsibilities of a web developer, a day-to-day life, an interview with a web developer, and web developers’ workplace. After reading
          this page, readers will know more about what the web developer does, and many more interesting elements of being a web developer.

          2. Another website called careerfoundry also has some information about a day in the life of a web developer. The article written by Emily Stevens
          gives readers the full detailed schedule of a web developer named Sam. The schedule starting at 8.45am and ending at 6.30pm onwards illustrated
          his daily life of being at work. After that, is his review of a day, in which he considered all of the things he committed, confirmed his best
          challenge on that day, and his motivation. Link to the website:<li><a href= "https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/what-is-a-typical-day-in-the-life-of-a-web-developer/">what-is-a-typical-day-in-the-life-of-a-web-developer</a></li>

        <h6>Discussion</h6>
        <p>Being a web developer, there are some common kinds of work that any developer does such as, conducting meetings with clients or colleagues,
           website programming, testing and reviewing the applications, practicing pair programming or other teamwork activities. Just like other IT
           professionals, their work always requires meeting with clients, and other web developing colleagues at the workplace. It is likely that
           most of the time of a web developer is spent on working with websites at their workplace, on their workstation. According to Sam, a web
           developer in my second summary, his most challenging part of his productivity on a daily basis is receiving ad-hoc requests from other
           teams. Generally, the most challenging part for most web developers is to learn a new framework, language, etc.  Although it is very
           interesting and amazing when mastering them, they can be very time-consuming.
