        <h1>Five IT Professionals</h1><br><br><br><br>
        <h2>Cybersecurity Professionals</h2>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>1. Life of a cybersecurity professional can vary in many aspects. In a youtube video called Cyber Security Day In the Life!
           (18 year old Cyber Security Engineer), an 18 year old cybersecurity engineer shared his daily life, we can see he showed
           us all of his activities in a day including his meals, working tasks, and talked about the task’s details. According to
           the video, it seems like his objective is to work on setting up some sort of a scanner that can scan devices on the
           company’s network for vulnerabilities which is called openvas. The video shows the time lapse of his activities, which
           were about doing research on the Internet, looking for reading materials and studying them. It is quite impressive that
           he was just 18 years old. Here is the link:<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdQV4Ci3v0M">Cyber Security Day
           In the Life! (18 year old Cyber Security Engineer)</a></li>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>2. A website called Varonis supports readers with information about a day in a life in cybersecurity. In the website, they
           have collected details of  a day in the life of many job roles regarding cybersecurity in order to give us the best
           perspective about the domain. These details are backgrounds, day-to-day schedule, pros and cons of some job roles such
           as cybersecurity engineer, analyst, and other professionals. The website has revealed the insights of cybersecurity in
           so many aspects. Link to the website: <li><a href="https://www.varonis.com/blog/working-in-cybersecurity/">What Working
           in Cybersecurity is Really Like: A Day in the Life</a></li>
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>The work of cybersecurity professionals can be diverse with a lot of tasks such as working with tools to look for vulnerabilities
          and improve the IT infrastructure, learning new technologies, working with clients and customers. As mentioned, they have to interact
          with customers to help them solve the problems, and collaborate with their co-workers or their team to do projects. Professionals in
          cybersecurity spend most of their time at their workplace doing research on the Internet. For example, an 18 year old cyber security
          engineer has to stay on his workstation to work with his company’s project for an entire day, or in most of the cybersecurity jobs,
          they have to be at their workplace for many hours ( about 10 hours according to Varonis) just to have time to work with their customers.
          According to these two web sources, the most challenging aspect is that there is no typical day in cybersecurity, everyday is a different
          problem and challenge that they have to tackle; therefore, there are always new things to learn and adapt.

        <h2>Web Developer</h2>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>1. Computerscience.org has a section that shows us a typical day of a web developer. This page provides readers with information about the
          responsibilities of a web developer, a day-to-day life, an interview with a web developer, and web developers’ workplace. After reading
          this page, readers will know more about what the web developer does, and many more interesting elements of being a web developer.

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          2. Another website called careerfoundry also has some information about a day in the life of a web developer. The article written by Emily Stevens
          gives readers the full detailed schedule of a web developer named Sam. The schedule starting at 8.45am and ending at 6.30pm onwards illustrated
          his daily life of being at work. After that, is his review of a day, in which he considered all of the things he committed, confirmed his best
          challenge on that day, and his motivation. Link to the website:<li><a href= "https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/what-is-a-typical-day-in-the-life-of-a-web-developer/">what-is-a-typical-day-in-the-life-of-a-web-developer</a></li>
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>Being a web developer, there are some common kinds of work that any developer does such as, conducting meetings with clients or colleagues,
           website programming, testing and reviewing the applications, practicing pair programming or other teamwork activities. Just like other IT
           professionals, their work always requires meeting with clients, and other web developing colleagues at the workplace. It is likely that
           most of the time of a web developer is spent on working with websites at their workplace, on their workstation. According to Sam, a web
           developer in my second summary, his most challenging part of his productivity on a daily basis is receiving ad-hoc requests from other
           teams. Generally, the most challenging part for most web developers is to learn a new framework, language, etc.  Although it is very
           interesting and amazing when mastering them, they can be very time-consuming.

        <h2>Cloud Engineer</h2>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>1. Career.foundationmedicine.com shows a typical day of a cloud engineer named Jayesh. Aside from a brief introduction of Jayesh’s education
          level, there is also his past experience with the company Foundation Medicine. This website also provides the reason why Jayesh decided to join
          the company as well as the motivation to work as a cloud engineer. Readers can also understand how a cloud engineering team collaborates for a
          project. Lastly, Jayesh talked about his next project, which reviews a little about what cloud engineers do. Link to the website:<li><a href="https://careers.foundationmedicine.com/blogs/inside-our-fmiimpact/day-in-the-life-cloud-engineer">Day in the life of a cloud engineer</a></li>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          2. Another website called ctl.io released a blog page about a day in the life of a cloud engineer named Rebecca Skinner. After introducing the
          series of “A day in the life of”, the writer starts talking about the impression that the newcomer Skinner has brought to the whole time.
          Being a newbie that did not understand the language or tech stack that the cloud team was using nor knowing the products that were developed,
          Skinner has successfully run a workshop. The writer also provides what aspects of Skinner that make her done a great job such as quick learning
          ability. The next part of the blog is a detailed time table of what Skinner does in her typical day. Link to the website:<li><a href= "https://www.ctl.io/developers/blog/post/day-in-the-life-of-rebecca-skinner">what-is-a-typical-day-in-the-life-of-a-web-developer</a></li>
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>The tasks of cloud engineers can vary a little from companies, but there is some main work that cloud engineers do. Cloud engineers design,
          develop and implement cloud-applications, migrate applications to the cloud, and debug cloud stacks while also maintaining the existing system.
          Cloud engineers also have the responsibility to monitor data storage services and cloud management. Managerial skills are also important for a
          cloud engineer in order to negotiate with customers as well as collaborate with teammates. This job requires the engineers to collaborate with
          other cloud engineers, product owners and other internal stakeholders. Cloud engineers can work everywhere; however, companies with large IT
          or cloud infrastructure can provide a better environment. One of the most difficult aspects of being a good cloud engineer is meeting the
          requirements and innovation of the cloud provider. This requires efficient self study.

        <h2>Software Engineer</h2>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>1.	For the first video, I chose this video on YouTube with the title “A REAL Day in the Life of a Software Engineer” upload by a YouTube
          channel Justin Hammond. In this video, he shown us his daily routine working as a Software Engineer for a company named Silicon Slopes.
          Due to covid, he was forced spend his time working from home and through the video, we saw how he manage his leisure and work time
          effectively. His work mainly is about coding and maintaining the company system using exist function. During his work, sometime,
          he has to cooperate with his fellow colleague to perform a pair programming, which is said that can help members to watch and learn new
          things. Furthermore, he also had meetings with his company, it could be for business matters or just simply for leisure reason. Link of
          the video:<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1fc0FlCjyI">Justin Hammond - day in a life</a></li>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          2.	For the second video, I chose to sample another video from a YouTube channel Kalle Hallden, the title of the video is “What A Day In
          A Programmers Life Is Actually Like”. Similarly, to the first video, Kalle doesn’t go to an office to start a day of work due to Covid.
          He maintains a healthy and tidy work environment, since he has a problem called OCD. As been shown in the video, he is currently developing
          an app and fixing errors of his current project. Unlike Justin, Kelle doesn’t show himself cooperating with many colleagues much,  and his
          work are mainly individual. After a long day coding, he will start his healthy habit which help him relax and reset, which is meditating.
          Link of the video: <li><a href= " https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjMJsQx_O7o">Kalle Hallden - day in a life</a></li>
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>In my opinion, due to the affect of Covid, most Software Engineer have to refrain from going to work and stay at home and working online.
          Thanks to the nature of this job, with a computer alone, they can accomplish all of their works from home, so Covid won’t be affecting them
          too much. Therefore, it is essential for the Software Engineer to be able to manage their work time and leisure time appropriately. Take
          Justin for an example, though his field of work include a lot of jobs to be done on the plate, he has to manage his time accordingly to
          be able to keep himself relax and care for his family members, which has been shown on the video to be his child.  During their work, they
          are often have meeting with their colleague to discuss or work with each other to learn from each other, which I think is a very interesting
          activity.

        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>Being an IT support technician, people will need to do some common things like password reset, fixing installing  or uninstalling app problems,fixing
          email not sending or not receiving email problems to hard things like monitoring and maintaining the computer system and  network of the company or
          organization. As an IT support technician, their work requires meeting with other clients at their workplace or receiving calls or chat from the customer.
          Most of the time, they will spend their time meeting their client through call or chat at their workplace. According to Mai, the main challenge of this
          position is all about content. In general, the most challenging part of working as an IT support technician is that you need to handle several different
          applications at the same time and it will be time consuming.
