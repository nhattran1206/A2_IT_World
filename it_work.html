          1. Life of a cybersecurity professional can vary in many aspects. In a youtube video called Cyber Security Day In the Life!
           (18 year old Cyber Security Engineer), an 18 year old cybersecurity engineer shared his daily life, we can see he showed
           us all of his activities in a day including his meals, working tasks, and talked about the task’s details. According to
           the video, it seems like his objective is to work on setting up some sort of a scanner that can scan devices on the
           company’s network for vulnerabilities which is called openvas. The video shows the time lapse of his activities, which
           were about doing research on the Internet, looking for reading materials and studying them. It is quite impressive that
           he was just 18 years old. Here is the link:<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdQV4Ci3v0M">Cyber Security Day
