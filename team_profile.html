        My full name is Tran Minh Nhat, and my student number is s3924826. I speak Vietnamese mainly and English is my second language.
        I studied English because I know the importance of having another language that can help you a lot. I am now in my first year at
        RMIT University. I usually read light novels and play games in my free time, but I also play piano and go skateboarding. I
        discovered that the IT business offers such a diverse range of vocations and domains that it is incredible that a late-twentieth-century
        major can develop so swiftly. I selected IT because I believe this industry will be one of the potential leaders of mankind's science
        and technology. I had heard of the phrase IT for three or four years, but it was only five months ago when I was deciding on my
        university course that I began to explore some of its ideas. As a result, I must state that my senior year of high school encouraged
        me to learn more, and it was around this time that my interest was developed. Through half of my first semester, I have gained some
        basic experience of Python language, basic concepts of computer systems, and building simple websites with HTML. </p>

      <p><img src="images/a2.jpg" alt="Di">
        My name is Doan Thien Di.  My birthday is September 15th, 2003. My student ID is s3926977.  I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City.
        This is my first semester at RMIT University as a first-year student.  I can speak Vietnamese, English.  I am not a sporty person and
        I rarely do sports. However, I can play table tennis as it was compulsory in my secondary school. I love reading, from novels to articles
        or interesting facts about the world around us. My free time is spent on learning new skills, especially new languages. I am interested
        in AI when talking about my favorite field of IT. I have participated in some competitions, such as the WRO or the Arduino competition
        between high schools in HCMC.</p>
